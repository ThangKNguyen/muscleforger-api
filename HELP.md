### Maven Parent overrides

Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM.
While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent.
To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements.
If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.

## What the Frontend Is

**Muscle Forger** — a React 18 + Vite fitness app.

- Users search and browse exercises by body part, name, target muscle, or equipment
- Each exercise has a detail page (animated GIF, muscle info, YouTube videos, similar exercises)
- Users can favorite exercises, build a workout list, and view browsing history
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Fully client-side right now — no backend exists yet

**Frontend repo:** `React-Fitness-App/my-react-app/`
**Frontend runs on:** `http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev server)

---

## Current State (What Needs to Change)

### API Keys Exposed
RapidAPI keys are currently hardcoded in the frontend `.env` file and called directly from the browser. The backend must proxy these calls so keys never reach the client.

### User Data in localStorage
Favorites, workout list, and recently viewed are stored in `localStorage` with no user account. Once auth exists, these migrate to Postgres tied to the authenticated user.

| Hook | localStorage Key | Data |
|------|-----------------|------|
| `useFavorites` | `mf_favorites` | Array of exercise objects |
| `useWorkout` | `mf_workout` | Array of exercise objects |
| `useRecentlyViewed` | `mf_recently_viewed` | Array of exercise objects (capped at ~10) |

### No Caching
Every page load triggers fresh RapidAPI calls. The backend should cache exercise data (exercises don't change) to avoid hammering the rate limit.

---

## Exercise Data Shape

All exercise objects from ExerciseDB look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "0001",
  "name": "3/4 sit-up",
  "bodyPart": "waist",
  "equipment": "body weight",
  "gifUrl": "https://v2.exercisedb.io/image/...",
  "target": "abs",
  "secondaryMuscles": ["hip flexors", "lower back"],
  "instructions": ["Lie down...", "Bend your knees..."]
}
```

---

## RapidAPI Endpoints to Proxy

The backend should expose these as its own REST endpoints, calling RapidAPI internally.

### ExerciseDB (via `exercisedb.p.rapidapi.com`)

| Frontend needs | RapidAPI call | Backend endpoint to expose |
|---------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Body part list | `GET /exercises/bodyPartList` | `GET /api/exercises/body-parts` |
| All exercises | `GET /exercises?limit=100` | `GET /api/exercises?limit=100` |
| Search (full list) | `GET /exercises?limit=900` | `GET /api/exercises/search?q={query}` — filter server-side |
| By body part | `GET /exercises/bodyPart/{bodyPart}?limit=100` | `GET /api/exercises/body-part/{bodyPart}` |
| By target muscle | `GET /exercises/target/{target}` | `GET /api/exercises/target/{target}` |
| By equipment | `GET /exercises/equipment/{equipment}` | `GET /api/exercises/equipment/{equipment}` |
| Single exercise | `GET /exercises/exercise/{id}` | `GET /api/exercises/{id}` |

### YouTube Search (via `youtube-search-and-download.p.rapidapi.com`)

| Frontend needs | RapidAPI call | Backend endpoint to expose |
|---------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Exercise videos | `GET /search?query={name} exercise` | `GET /api/videos?exercise={name}` |

> Results are sliced to 3 items on the frontend. Backend can return more; frontend handles slicing.

---

## Auth API Contract

### Endpoints needed

```
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/refresh
POST /api/auth/logout
GET  /api/auth/me
```

### Register
```json
// Request
{ "email": "user@example.com", "password": "securepassword", "username": "thang" }

// Response 201
{ "token": "eyJ...", "refreshToken": "eyJ...", "user": { "id": 1, "email": "...", "username": "..." } }
```

### Login
```json
// Request
{ "email": "user@example.com", "password": "securepassword" }

// Response 200
{ "token": "eyJ...", "refreshToken": "eyJ...", "user": { "id": 1, "email": "...", "username": "..." } }
```

### Me (requires Bearer token)
```json
// Response 200
{ "id": 1, "email": "user@example.com", "username": "thang" }
```

**Token storage on frontend:** JWT stored in `localStorage` or `httpOnly` cookie (TBD). Frontend will send `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header on protected requests.

---

## User Data API Contract

All endpoints below require `Authorization: Bearer {token}`.

### Favorites

```
GET    /api/user/favorites              → list all favorites
POST   /api/user/favorites              → add favorite       body: { exerciseId: "0001" }
DELETE /api/user/favorites/{exerciseId} → remove favorite
```

### Workout List

```
GET    /api/user/workout                → list workout exercises
POST   /api/user/workout                → add to workout     body: { exerciseId: "0001" }
DELETE /api/user/workout/{exerciseId}   → remove from workout
DELETE /api/user/workout                → clear entire workout
```

### Recently Viewed

```
GET  /api/user/history                  → list recently viewed (latest first)
POST /api/user/history                  → log a view         body: { exerciseId: "0001" }
```

> Recently viewed is auto-logged when a user visits `/exercise/:id`. Cap at 20 entries per user, drop oldest.

---

## CORS

The backend must allow requests from the frontend origin:

```
http://localhost:5173   ← Vite dev server
```

Configure `@CrossOrigin` or a global `CorsConfigurationSource` bean in Spring Security.

---

## Suggested Backend Implementation Order

1. **DB + JPA setup** — connect to Postgres, verify connection
2. **Flyway migrations** — create `users`, `favorites`, `workout_exercises`, `recently_viewed` tables
3. **Auth** — register/login with Spring Security + JWT
4. **Exercise proxy endpoints** — proxy RapidAPI calls with server-side caching (`ConcurrentHashMap` or Spring Cache + `@Scheduled` refresh)
5. **User data endpoints** — favorites, workout, history (reads/writes to Postgres)
6. **Frontend wiring** — update frontend to call backend instead of RapidAPI directly; add TanStack Query for caching + Zustand for auth state

---

## Concurrency Opportunities

These are real multi-threading use cases in this project — not manufactured:

- **Parallel API calls**: Exercise detail page fires 4 RapidAPI calls. Use `CompletableFuture.allOf()` to run them concurrently instead of sequentially.
- **Thread-safe cache**: Exercise data is fetched frequently and changes rarely. Cache with `ConcurrentHashMap`, refresh via `@Scheduled` + thread pool.
- **HikariCP tuning**: Configure the DB connection pool for concurrent user requests.
- **Rate limit coordination**: Multiple users hitting exercise endpoints simultaneously — coordinate threads so they don't all hit RapidAPI at once; serve from cache instead.

How the Login Flow Works

1. POST /api/auth/login  { email, password }
   │
   ▼
2. Spring Security checks email + password against DB
   │
   ▼
3. If correct → generate JWT token
   │
   ▼
4. Return token to client
   │
   ▼
5. Client stores token, sends it on every future request:
   Authorization: Bearer eyJ...
   │
   ▼
6. JwtAuthFilter intercepts the request, validates token
   │
   ▼
7. If valid → Spring Security knows who the user is
   → request proceeds to the controller
